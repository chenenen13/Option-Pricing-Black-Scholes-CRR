## You shall find here all my school projects and personnal projects on algo trading and quantitative analysis. Hello everyone, you will find here some of my works on the trading strategies and analysis using fundamental and simple financial and machine learning models. These models and algorithms are certainly not the most original ones. The idea behinds my work is simply using school learning materials and apply my knowledge into practical fields. All comments, critics or advices are welcomed in the section comment. I am seeking to learn and improve my mathematical skills as well as my coding techniques in the field of trading and financial markets.
