## School Project on Black Scholes and Cox-Ross-Rubenstein pricer on C++

1) Introduction to Financial Options: This section provides a detailed introduction to financial options, explaining their significance, types (such as European and American options), and basic properties. It sets the foundation for understanding the subsequent modeling techniques.

2) C++ Programming Foundations: This part delves deeper into C++ programming aspects crucial for financial modeling. It covers object-oriented programming concepts including classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and their application in financial calculations.

3) Black-Scholes Model Implementation: In this section, the Black-Scholes model, a fundamental model for option pricing, is thoroughly explored. The implementation details in C++ are explained, focusing on how to apply this model to calculate option prices.

4) Cox-Ross-Rubinstein Model: This segment introduces the Cox-Ross-Rubinstein binomial model, particularly important for pricing American options. The section includes detailed steps on implementing this model in C++, highlighting its differences and advantages over the Black-Scholes model.

5) Monte Carlo Simulations: Here, the project focuses on Monte Carlo simulations, a versatile technique for pricing options. It explains the implementation of these simulations in C++, including generating random paths and estimating option prices through simulation.

6) Advanced Topics: The final section covers advanced topics like path-dependent options and the complexities of pricing American options in binomial models. It includes intricate C++ implementations for these advanced financial modeling concepts, demonstrating more complex programming techniques and algorithms.

Each section combines theoretical finance concepts with practical C++ programming, providing a comprehensive learning experience in financial modeling and C++ programming.
